# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through arrays. The error occurs because the loop condition incorrectly includes the last index which is beyond the array bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution shows how to correct the loop condition to avoid this error.

## Bug
The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. 

## Solution
The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code with the proper loop condition.
